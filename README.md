## Architecture

ReplyRocket.io follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **API Layer**: HTTP interface with request validation
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
3. **CRUD Layer**: Database operations
4. **Model Layer**: Database schema definitions

This architecture ensures separation of concerns and testability.

## Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy is comprehensive, covering all layers of the application:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. We use pytest for our testing framework and unittest.mock for isolating components.

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_campaign_service.py

# Run with coverage report
python tests/run_coverage.py
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests ensure that different components work together correctly.

```bash
# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/
```

### Stress Tests

Stress tests evaluate system performance under high load.

```bash
# Run stress tests
python -m pytest tests/test_campaign_stress.py
```

### Code Coverage

We aim for high test coverage to ensure code quality and reliability.

```bash
# Generate coverage report
python tests/run_coverage.py

# View HTML coverage report
# Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser
```

For more detailed information about our testing approach, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
