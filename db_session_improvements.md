# Database Session Handling Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to database session handling in the ReplyRocket.io application to enhance reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Ensure all database interactions use proper lifecycle management
2. Refactor manual database session handling to use context managers
3. Enhance logging for database errors to detect connection leaks
4. Implement performance testing to verify improvements

## üîß Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Management

- **Context Manager Support**: Added `SessionManager` class in `app/db/session.py` for easier session management with proper cleanup
- **Pool Configuration**: Added configurable connection pool settings in `app/core/config.py`:
  - DB_POOL_SIZE: Default pool size
  - DB_MAX_OVERFLOW: Maximum number of overflow connections
  - DB_POOL_TIMEOUT: Timeout for acquiring a connection
  - DB_POOL_RECYCLE: Time interval after which connections are recycled

### 2. Improved Error Handling

- **Enhanced Error Logging**: Updated `handle_db_error` in `app/utils/error_handling.py` to:
  - Log detailed stack traces for better debugging
  - Add specific logging for connection-related errors
  - Detect potential session leaks through ResourceClosedError tracking
  - Provide more informative error messages for IntegrityError cases

### 3. Dependency Injection

- **Enhanced get_db Dependency**: Updated `get_db` in `app/api/deps.py` to include:
  - Detailed logging on session creation and closure
  - Proper exception handling with clear error messages
  - Session tracking to identify potential leaks

### 4. Session Monitoring

- **Session Tracking**: Added new `app/utils/db_monitor.py` module providing:
  - Registration and tracking of active database sessions
  - Detection of long-running sessions that might indicate issues
  - Statistics on session usage patterns and potential leaks
  - Automatic cleanup verification to ensure sessions are properly closed

### 5. Background Task Improvements

- **Context Manager Usage**: Updated background tasks in `app/utils/email.py` to:
  - Use context managers for database sessions
  - Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
  - Ensure sessions are always closed, even during exceptions

## üß™ Testing Tools

### Performance Testing

Added `tests/test_db_performance.py` with capabilities to:
- Compare direct session usage vs. context manager performance
- Test concurrent session performance with multiple threads
- Measure API endpoint performance related to database operations
- Track and report session statistics during tests

### Leak Detection

Added `tests/scan_for_db_leaks.py` with capabilities to:
- Scan codebase for potential database session leaks
- Identify places where sessions might not be properly closed
- Detect various session handling patterns and suggest improvements
- Produce detailed reports on database session usage throughout the application

## üìä Performance Impact

The session handling improvements have resulted in:
- Reduced risk of connection leaks
- More efficient connection pooling
- Improved error handling and debugging capabilities
- Better session lifecycle management through context managers

## üöÄ Best Practices Implemented

1. **Use of context managers** for automatic session cleanup
2. **Dependency injection** through FastAPI dependencies
3. **Proper error handling** with specific exception types
4. **Comprehensive logging** for database operations
5. **Monitoring and statistics** for session usage patterns
6. **Connection pooling** configuration for optimal performance

## üìù Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any remaining session leaks
2. Consider implementing a session timeout mechanism for very long operations
3. Add more detailed metrics for database performance monitoring
4. Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for database failures
